## interact with our lab

It is important to read papers related to what we did also think about what else you might be interested in.
So you will be starting working on infrastructure but remember that these infrastructure related things are not research and will not going to be papers. So you need to think about ideas and about research directions. So it is important to read papers from top conferences like ESEC/FSE and ICSE. These are 2 important conferences.
So don’t get demotivated about today’s feedback but we have some significant results and we can publish paper. So regarding data cleaning please read the issues I have put it on the zenhub. I assigned it to you as well then you can also think about answering of these questions. Again, we both need to read papers and answer professor Rajan’s concerns.
Please confirm that you got this texts and let me know your thought. (edited)
I added motivation and related works on the Github.
Please confirm that you got the notification and you will be going to search for the related works and think about motivation of the work?
I already put so many related works. You can read them as well and give me your thought on this. (edited)
Thank you.
