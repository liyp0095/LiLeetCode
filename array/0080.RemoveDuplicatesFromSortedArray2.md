# Problem

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

- thoughts

  similar to RDSA1, it is time consuming that erase every time we found duplicates. So we use pointers to modify the vector.

  Two pointers i,j, if nums[i] equals nums[i+1] then it means we have two nums that equals to each other. We need to find next nums[j] that not equals to nums[i] and put it into nums[i+2]


- Solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() <= 2) {
            return nums.size();
        }

        int i = 0;
        int j = 2;
        for ( ; j < nums.size(); j ++ ) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i+1]) {
                if (nums[i] != nums[j]) {
                    nums[i+2] = nums[j];
                    i ++ ;
                }
            } else {
                nums[i+2] = nums[j];
                i ++ ;
            }
        }
        nums.erase(nums.begin() + i + 2, nums.end());

        return nums.size();
    }
};
```

- another Solution

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i=0;

        for(int n : nums)
            if(i < 2 || n > nums[i-2])
                nums[i++] = n;
        return i;
    }
};
```
