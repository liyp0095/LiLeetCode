# Problem

Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."

Example:

Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.


## thoughts

- sort first, O(nlogn)
- iterate, if remain number of paper <= citation now. return remain number of paper. O(n). 

## C++

- sort? ```sort(vector.begin(), vector.end());

### solution

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& citations) {
        sort(citations.begin(), citations.end());
        for (int i = 0; i < citations.size(); i ++ ) {
            if (citations.size() - i <= citations[i]) {
                return citations.size() - i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
```
